* Refreshing the results with a model with fixed parameters;
* Option for fixing the coefficient of pre-specified regression variables
* Option to use of backcasts in X11;
* Test for detecting residual calendar effects;
* The modified Ljung-Box test and the F-test test for detecting a residual seasonality;
