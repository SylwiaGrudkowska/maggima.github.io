The default JDemetra+ window, which is displayed after launching the program, is clearly divided into several panels. 
The key parts of the user interface are: 
* The [Providers](data-providers.html) window, which organises time series; 
* The [Workspace](workspace.html) window, which stores results generated by the software as well as settings used to create them; 
* A central empty zone for presenting the actual analyses further called the Results panel.
The majority of functionalities are available from the main menu of the 
application, which is situated at the very top of the main window. If 
the user moves the cursor to an entry in the main menu and clicks on the 
left mouse button, a drop-down menu will appear. Clicking on an entry in 
the drop-down menu selects the highlighted item.

 The functions available in the main menu of the application are explained below.
## File menu
 The *File* menu is intended for working with [workspaces](workspace.html) and [data sources](data-providers.html) .  
It offers the following functions:  
* **New Workspace** – creates a new workspace and displays it in the Workspace window with a default name (*Workspace_#number*); 
* **Open Workspace** – opens a dialog window, which enables the user to select and open an existing workspace; 
* **Open Recent Workspace** – presents a list of workspaces recently created by the user and enables the user to open one of them; 
* **Save Workspace** – saves the project file named by the system under the default name (*Workspace_#number*) and in a default location. The workspace can be re-opened at a later point in time; 
* **Save Workspace As…** – saves the project file named by the user in the chosen location. The workspace can be re-opened at a later point in time; 
* **Open Recent** – presents a list of datasets recently used and enables the user to open one of them; 
* **Exit** – closes an application.

## Statistical methods menu
The Statistical methods menu includes functionalities for modelling, analysis and seasonal ad-justment of a time series. They are divided into three groups:
* **Anomaly Detection** – allows for a purely automatic identification of regression effects;
* **Modelling** – enables time series modelling using the TRAMO and RegARIMA models; 
* **Seasonal adjustment** – intended for seasonal adjustment of the time series with the TRAMO/SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS methods.

## View menu
The View menu contains functionalities allowing for customising the view of an application to the user needs. It offers the following items:
* **Split** – the function is not operational in the current version of the software.
* **Toolbars** – displays selected toolbars under the main menu. The File toolbar contains the Save all icon. The Performance toolbar includes two icons: one to show the perfor-mance of the application, the other to stop application profiling and take a snapshot. The Other toolbar determines the default behaviour of the program when the user double clicks on the data. It may be useful to plot the data, visualise it on a grid, or to perform any pre-specified action, e.g. execute a seasonal adjustment procedure.
* **Show Only Editor** – displays only the Results panel and hides other windows (e.g. Workspace and Providers).
* **Full Screen** – displays the current JDemetra+ view in the full screen.

## Tools menu
The Tools menu includes, among other functionalities, tools which are helpful for a graphical analysis of the time series. The ‘X-13ARIMA-SEATS Reference Manual’ (2015) strongly recom-mends studying a high resolution plot of the time series as it is helpful to get information about e.g. seasonal patterns, potential outliers and stochastic non-stationarity. Also the ‘ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment’ (2015) recommend carrying out a graphical analysis on both unadjusted data and the initial run of the seasonal adjustment software. In particular, the graphical analysis should consider: 
* The length of the series and a model span;  
* The presence of zeros, outliers or problems in the data;  
* The structure of the series: presence of a long term and cyclical movements, of a sea-sonal component, volatility etc.;  
* The presence of possible breaks in the seasonal behaviour;  
* The decomposition scheme (additive, multiplicative).
The ‘ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment’ (2015), recommend that this exercise should be per-formed and documented for the most important series to be adjusted at least once a year.
The following functionalities are available from the Tools menu:
* **Container** – includes several tools for displaying data in a time domain;
* **Spectral analysis** – contains tools for analysis of time series in a frequency domain;
* **Aggregation** – enables the user to investigate the graph of the sum of multiple time se-ries;
* **Differencing** – allows for inspection the first regular differences of the time series;
* **Spreadsheet profiler** – offers the Excel-type view of the XLS file imported to JDe-metra+.
* **Plugins** – allows the installation and activation of plugins, which extend JDemetra+ functionalities.
* **Options** – presents the default interface settings and allows for their modification.
